## Abstract

Counterfeiting affects diverse industries, including pharmaceuticals, electronics, and food, posing serious health and economic risks. Printable unclonable codes, such as Copy Detection Patterns (CDPs), are widely used as an anti-counterfeiting measure and are applied to products and packaging. However, the increasing availability of high-resolution printing and scanning devices, along with advances in generative deep learning, undermines traditional authentication systems, which often fail to distinguish high-quality counterfeits from genuine prints.

In this work, we propose a diffusion-based authentication framework that jointly leverages the original binary template, the printed CDP, and a representation of printer identity that captures relevant semantic information. Formulating authentication as multi-class printer classification over printer signatures lets our model capture fine-grained, device-specific features via spatial and textual conditioning. We extend ControlNet by repurposing the denoising process for class-conditioned noise prediction, enabling effective printer classification.

On the Indigo $1\times1$ Base dataset, our method outperforms traditional similarity metrics and prior deep learning approaches. Results show the framework generalizes to counterfeit types unseen during training.

## Problem Setting

The framework authenticates a candidate CDP by checking whether its predicted printer identity matches the expected authentic printer identity. The model is conditioned on:

1. The binary template.
2. The printed CDP.
3. A text description of printer identity.

Authentication is then a decision over printer classes rather than a direct similarity threshold.

$$
\hat{c} = \arg\min_{c_i} \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \| \epsilon - f_\theta(x_t, t, z, c_i) \|_2^2 \right]
$$

A sample is accepted as authentic only if $\hat{c}=c^*$.
